/*
Write a Java method that takes a string as input and determines whether it is a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, 
ignoring spaces, punctuation, and letter casing.

Example:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true

Input: "Java programming"
Output: false

 */
public class Main {
    
    String input = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama";

 * 
 * user resource
I want quick APis CRUD
by CRUD I mean GET, POST, PUT, DELETE


    /users      -> GET      -> get all users List<User> 
    /user/:id   -> GET      -> 1 result
    /user       -> POST     -> create new user, persist in the DB 
    /user/:id   -> PUT      -> update operation
    /users/:id  -> DELETE   -> delete operation

    appMart (inhouse) -> b2b (ReactJS, Java, AWS, Kubernetes), b2c (business 2 client) -> BlinkIT, Zomato
    some other project -> complex project, DATA related, GDRIVE example - connections via API - OAuth2 - API key in case of sopify

    Last question: will there be need of working on AI in future.
